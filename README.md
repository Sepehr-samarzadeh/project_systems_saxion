# Autonomous Line Chasing Car

Welcome to the Autonomous Line Chasing Car project! This repository contains the code for a car that can autonomously follow a line, avoid obstacles, and climb hills. The car achieves this functionality using a combination of IR sensors, an ultrasonic sensor, and a gyroscope.

## Features

- **Line Chasing:** The car uses three IR sensors to detect and follow a line.
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** An ultrasonic sensor enables the car to detect and avoid obstacles in its path.
- **Hill Climbing:** A gyroscope allows the car to detect inclines and adjust its movement accordingly.

## Components

- **IR Sensors (x3):** Used for detecting the line on the ground.
- **Ultrasonic Sensor (x1):** Used for detecting obstacles in the car's path.
- **Gyroscope (x1):** Used for detecting the angle of inclination to assist with hill climbing.
